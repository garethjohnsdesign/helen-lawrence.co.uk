Helen Lawrence hails from Whitley Bay, outside of Newcastle-upon- Tyne.  

She gained a textile degree at Chelsea College of Art & Design before going onto the MA Fashion at Central Saint Martins, graduating in 2012.
She soon started collaborating with CSM classmate and menswear talent Craig Green on his covetable knitwear.

Debuting her eponymous label with Fashion East for Autumn/Winter 2014, she caught the eye of esteemed press and buyers with her brushed mohair two-pieces, blanket coats and sweaters with PVC scribble stitch embroidery.

All fabrics are created by Helen in-house.
